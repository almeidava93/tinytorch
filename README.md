# tinytorch

This is a personal learning endeavour inspired by Andrej Karpathy's micrograd series. It extends his idea by developing a tensor based auto-differentiation engine with the building blocks to train simple neural networks. I developed it also inspired by pytorch design, which focus on simplicity and flexibility.
